# Powerpoint Slide Generator
This Windows Form application utilizes Google's Custom Search API to generate a Powerpoint slide from key words entered.
It takes in a title and text from the user, and uses the title words and bolded text words for the image search.

The user may then select which images to use for the slide generation.
